            This is cartoon is about the adventures of a 5 years old Boy ShinChan
            in his family his mother mitsi his father hiroshi and her sister himawari are there.<br>
            i reallt like shinchan as he is really funny and naughty but he helps his friends and doesent mean any harm to anyone :)
            he studies in the futaba kindergarden school. his friends are kazama masao bow and nani the girl. they all play together everyday.
            shinchan is the best cartoon i have ever seen.
